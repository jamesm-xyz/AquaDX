### Notes
* Some games may require additional patches and these will not provided in this project and repository. You already found this, so you know where to find related resources too.
* This repository may contain untested, experimental implementations for a few games which I can't test properly. If you couldn't find your wanted game in the above list, do not expect support.
* This server also provides a simple API for viewing play records and editing settings for some games.

### Usage (V1 Developmental Preview)

> [!NOTE]
> AquaDX v1 is currently under heavy development.
> If you were using SQLite Aqua before, it's not supported in AquaDX and the command below will create a new MariaDB database.
> We're working on a migration guide, which will be released along with AquaDX v1 stable.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/hykilpikonna/AquaDX` to clone this repo.
3. Run `docker compose up` in the AquaDX folder.

If you're getting BAD on title server checks after the docker server is up, please edit `config/application.properties` 
and change `allnet.server.host` to your LAN IP address (e.g. 192.168.0.?). You can find your LAN address using the `ipconfig` command on Windows or `ifconfig` on Linux. 

### Updating Instructions

> [!NOTE]
> Please back up your database before you update! Even though we want to avoid database issues as much as possible, it's still possible that unexpected things will happen.

Please run the commands below in the AquaDX folder to update:

```
# Backup your database
docker run --rm -it mariadb:latest mariadb-dump -h host.docker.internal --port 3369 --user=cat --password=meow main > backup.sql

# Pull the new repository
git pull

# Run the updated version
docker compose up
```

### Usage (Stable Old Version)

> [!WARNING]
> The instructions below is for the old version of AquaDX 0.0.47. This version does not support the latest features and games.

1. Install [Java 21 Temurin JDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21) (Please select your appropriate operating system)
2. Download the latest `aqua-nightly.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/AquaDX/releases).
3. Extract the zip file to a folder.
4. Run `java -jar aqua.jar` in the folder.

By default, Aqua will use SQLite and save user data in `data/db.sqlite`.

If you want to use optional databases, please edit the configuration file then it will auto-create the table and import some initial data.

### Configuration
Configuration is saved in `config/application.properties`, spring loads this file automatically.

* The host and port of game title servers can be overwritten in `allnet.server.host` and `allnet.server.port`. By default it will send the same host and port the client used the request this information.
This will be sent to the game at booting and being used by the following request.
* You can switch to the MariaDB database by commenting the Sqlite part.
* For some games, you might need to change some game-specific config entries.

### Building
You need to install JDK on your system. However, you don't need to install Gradle separately, as the `gradlew` wrapper script is included.
```
gradlew clean build
```
The `build/libs` folder will contain a jar file.
